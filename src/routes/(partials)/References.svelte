					I had the honor of getting to work with Aaron early in his career. He was always an avid
					learner and a dedicated developer. It's been so exciting to see him grow in his expertise
					and experience. I would highly recommend him for your Front End focused team!

					Aaron did a good job updating our entire website (switching to a more modern style) and
					also working on our product's web interface, converting it from JavaScript (and ext.js) to
					Vue. He's a very knowledgeable developer.

					I had the benefit of working side-by-side with Aaron as a frontend web developer at
					Caleres for a number of years. He is thoughtful and creative with his problem solving, and
					he puts in the effort to make sure his work is always quality down to the detail. His
					pressence at work was a joy as he always had something nice to say or a story to share. He
					would be a wonderful addition to any team seeking his talents!

					I had the pleasure of being a project manager on a team with Aaron as a front-end
					developer and cannot recommend him enough. He has great attention to detail and accuracy,
					communicates professionally, and always delivered his projects on time. In addition to
					that, he's a supportive and friendly team member. Would love to work with him again!

					As a volunteer Aaron proactively contacted me to complete a redesign of Campbell House
					Museum's website (we are a small non-profit). Over a period of about 5 months Aaron worked
					to create a new concept in updating the web presence for Campbell House that would be easy
					to maintain. He exceeded our expectations and was a pleasure to work with, highly
					recommended!
